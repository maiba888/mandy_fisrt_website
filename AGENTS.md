# Luxe Trade Catalog - Agent Handover Guide

Read this file completely before changing, deploying, synchronizing, or
troubleshooting this project.

## 1. Source Of Truth And Release Topology

- Tencent Cloud (`43.166.137.208`) is the only production primary.
- The canonical production URL is `https://bebeauty.top/`; both
  `bebeauty.top` and `www.bebeauty.top` resolve to Tencent Cloud.
- GitHub (`xie666888/mandy_fisrt_website`) stores source code and operational
  documentation only.
- Alibaba Cloud (`101.132.36.115`) is the warm standby. Never edit products,
  images, the database, or application code there directly.
- Production changes flow in one direction:
  `local development -> GitHub -> Tencent Cloud -> rsync -> Alibaba Cloud`.
- Product/admin changes made on Tencent Cloud are copied to Alibaba Cloud by the
  automated sync. Never reverse this direction unless disaster recovery has
  been explicitly declared.
- Never synchronize a live SQLite database file with plain `rsync`. Create a
  consistent SQLite backup first, then transfer and atomically install it.
- Before enabling `luxe-replication.timer`, all active catalog/order entry
  points must lead to Tencent. A legacy domain may remain on Alibaba only when
  it redirects catalog traffic to `https://bebeauty.top/`; otherwise Alibaba
  could receive orders that the next replication would replace.

## 2. Secrets And Production Data

- Never commit or write passwords, session secrets, private SSH keys, `.env`
  files, database files, product images, customer orders, generated order
  workbooks, backups, or original catalog Excel files into Git.
- Server secrets live only in `/etc/luxe-catalog.env` with mode `0600`.
- SSH private keys remain under the operator's `~/.ssh` or the relevant server's
  `/root/.ssh`. This guide contains aliases and paths, never key contents.
- Do not replace a server environment file while deploying code.
- Do not copy local product data or images over production. Tencent production
  is authoritative.

## 3. Runtime Layout

Both cloud servers use the same application layout:

| Purpose | Path |
| --- | --- |
| Application source | `/opt/luxe-catalog` |
| Python virtual environment | `/opt/luxe-catalog/.venv` |
| SQLite database | `/var/lib/luxe-catalog/catalog.sqlite3` |
| Uploaded images/thumbnails | `/var/lib/luxe-catalog/uploads` |
| Environment file | `/etc/luxe-catalog.env` |
| Application service | `luxe-catalog.service` |
| Nginx configuration | `/etc/nginx/conf.d/luxe-catalog.conf` |
| TLS certificate chain | `/etc/nginx/ssl/bebeauty.top/fullchain.crt` |
| TLS private key | `/etc/nginx/ssl/bebeauty.top/private.key` |
| Daily backups | `/var/backups/luxe-catalog` |

The Python application listens only on `127.0.0.1:4173`. Nginx is the public
entry point. Do not expose port `4173`.

The `bebeauty.top` certificate covers the root and `www` names. Certbot now
manages `/etc/letsencrypt/live/bebeauty.top/`; the deploy hook
`/etc/letsencrypt/renewal-hooks/deploy/30-luxe-certificate` installs renewed
files into the Nginx paths above and validates/reloads Nginx. The certificate
issued on 2026-09-30 expires on 2026-12-28; verify live dates and the
`certbot-renew.timer` rather than relying on this date. Never
commit or synchronize the certificate private key through Git or application
rsync. Keep `HTTPS=1` so admin session cookies retain the `Secure` flag.

## 4. Local And Server SSH

Recommended local aliases:

```text
ssh luxe-tencent
ssh luxe-alibaba
```

Tencent-to-Alibaba replication uses a dedicated key and the unprivileged
`luxesync` account. Alibaba-to-Tencent trust exists for diagnostics, but normal
replication is always Tencent to Alibaba.

Replication definitions are versioned in `deployment/replication/`. The
Tencent timer runs every 15 minutes after it is explicitly enabled. A manual
replication and verification must pass before enabling the timer.

Do not re-enable SSH password login. Do not weaken `AllowUsers`, Fail2ban,
firewall, login rate limiting, or the systemd sandbox to make a deployment
easier.

## 5. Application Architecture

- Backend: Python standard-library HTTP server in `server.py`.
- Database: SQLite with WAL-aware backup handling.
- Frontend: `index.html`, `src/app.js`, and `src/styles.css`.
- Spreadsheet output: `openpyxl`.
- Images: original-resolution files are preserved. Nginx serves product and
  uploaded images directly with long-lived cache headers.
- Authentication: server-side session cookies. Admin access must never return
  to a hard-coded browser password or local-only authentication.

## 6. Product And Admin Rules

- Catalog Excel import/export has been retired. Do not restore catalog import,
  catalog export, reset-from-Excel, or bulk replacement endpoints/UI.
- Order Excel download must remain available to authenticated administrators.
- The admin sales report shows the top 20 products by cumulative quantity in
  submitted orders and supports an authenticated all-products Excel export.
  The export includes unsold products with zero values and keeps `Units Sold`
  as its final column. Export rows default to Brand A-Z, then Item Name and
  SKU, so customers can review one brand at a time; the merchant can sort the
  full catalog by Units Sold to find the top 20. This is demand data, not
  verified paid-sales data; keep the report read-only and do not change the
  order schema when extending it.
- Creating an order stores its items in SQLite and sends only the order number
  through WhatsApp.
- Product deletion means archive. Never physically delete the database row from
  normal admin operations. Archived products disappear from active listings.
- Products with similar names, SKUs, sizes, or images are still independent
  rows. Never deduplicate products by name, SKU, brand, image, or description.
- Required admin fields: SKU, Brand, Item, Price, Colors/shade options.
- Price and weight must be numeric and greater than zero. Their labels must show
  units.
- Brand input supports type-ahead selection from existing brands and creation
  of a genuinely new brand.
- Main image and each detail image are independently removable. Removing one
  thumbnail must never clear the entire image list.
- Image filenames may contain Chinese or other Unicode characters.
- Admin uploads should show lightweight thumbnails, not filesystem/URL path
  text fields.
- Admin product lists require search and pagination. Saving or archiving must
  give visible feedback near the action, not only at the top of a long page.

## 7. Storefront Behaviour

- NEW ARRIVALS includes public, non-archived products first published or edited
  within the last 30 days. Edits and republication must preserve the first
  publication timestamp, while `updated_at` records recent product changes such
  as adding shade options or images. Legacy products with unknown publication
  dates can still enter NEW ARRIVALS when they are actually edited; drafts and
  archived products remain excluded.
- Best seller marks up to 10 public, non-archived products by cumulative quantity
  in submitted orders, grouped by stable product ID. These are demand orders,
  not verified paid sales. Ties use product ID; zero-order products are excluded.
  Run python scripts/test_merchandising.py when changing these rules.

- Use Arial for storefront UI, admin UI, and every cell in generated order
  Excel files. Order workbooks must also set the Normal/default font to Arial
  and remove theme font schemes; otherwise Chinese Excel can display Songti
  even when populated cells report Arial.
- Color/shade options split only on `/`. Spaces and hyphens are literal content:
  `1/2/3` becomes three choices; `1-2-3` and `1 2 3` remain one choice.
- The admin `Colors / shade options` field is authoritative when saving a
  product. `Colors:` text inside Product information is only a legacy/display
  fallback when stored colors are empty, and must never override explicit admin
  color input.
- Size, gross weight, and net weight are product information, not selectable
  shade/type options.
- Add-to-cart must keep the customer on the current page and show a clear cart
  animation/confirmation. Navigation to the cart happens only from the cart
  control.
- Europe shipping uses product weight directly through 6 kg: up to 0.7 kg is
  $31.20; over 0.7 through 1.5 kg is $35.20; over 1.5 through 2 kg is $43.80;
  over 2 through 3 kg is $52.30; over 3 through 4 kg is $61.80; over 4
  through 5 kg is $72.30; over 5 through 6 kg is $81.40.
- Only when Europe product weight is over 6 kg, add 2 kg packaging and round
  the result up to the next 0.5 kg, then charge $10.80/kg. For example,
  7.23 kg becomes 9.5 kg and 7.68 kg becomes 10 kg. United States rates do
  not use this Europe packaging rule. Keep the browser estimate, server-side
  order calculation, stored order weights, and Excel summary identical.
- Customer and admin-visible order summaries show only Shipping weight, never
  Product weight. Order Excel item rows include a Product weight(kg) detail
  column, but the Excel summary area must not include a Product weight summary.
  Product weight remains stored internally for calculating Shipping weight.
- Order Excel files must not include an SKU column. Product images in order
  Excel should render in the Picture column at about 119px width while
  preserving the source image aspect ratio, keeping roughly 6-7 order rows
  visible per screen in common Excel views.
- Order Excel item rows are grouped by Brand + Item Name + Unit Price +
  Picture. Shade/Type contains one shade per line, QTY is the grouped total,
  and the Informations column contains one line per shade in the format
  `Shade * QTY PCS`.
- Order Excel summary values must be formula-driven, not static values, so
  manual item-row insertions/deletions can recalculate product totals, shipping
  weight, shipping cost and total. Generated item rows use formulas for Product
  weight(kg) and Extended price, with a hidden Unit weight helper column.
- Product images and related-product links must open the detail view at the top
  where selection and add-to-cart controls are visible.
- Product and media paths rendered by JavaScript must be root-relative
  (`/src/...`) or absolute. Never render stored `./src/...` paths unchanged on
  nested routes such as `/product/<id>`.
- Detail pages recommend other products from the same brand and category.
- Brand/category labels on product cards are clickable filters.
- Product cards have Quick Add, fixed image bounds, and preserve image aspect
  ratio without overflow.
- The header/search/cart area and the desktop brand sidebar remain usable while
  scrolling.
- Keep the product grid space-efficient. Do not restore the removed oversized
  hero/banner, price-range controls, or decorative top-right product blocks.
- Keep interfaces operational and compact: no nested cards, oversized
  marketing sections, or explanatory text that consumes product space.

## 8. Performance And Security Invariants

- Keep Nginx direct image serving, Gzip compression, open-file cache, immutable
  image caching, security headers, and API/login rate limits.
- Keep Fail2ban jails for SSH, forbidden-path scans, and Nginx rate-limit abuse.
- Keep the backend bound to localhost and retain firewalld.
- Preserve the application systemd hardening directives and automatic restart.
- Do not add Redis without measured evidence. The current workload is
  read-heavy, SQLite is small, and Nginx/browser caching removes most static I/O.
- Avoid returning full-size image bytes from API responses; APIs return paths.
- Do not lower original image resolution as a performance shortcut. Use browser
  sizing, lazy loading, thumbnails in admin, and caching.

## 9. SEO And GEO Invariants

- Read `SEO_GEO_GUIDE.md` for the research, release checks, account-level next
  steps and platform eligibility limitations. Do not promise rankings or AI citations.
- Home and single-brand/category URLs are server-rendered from public SQLite
  rows. Nginx `location = /` MUST proxy to Python, not serve the empty static
  `index.html`. `/index.html` and HTTPS www redirect to canonical locations.
- Single-brand/category pages use self canonicals; combined filters, internal
  searches and NEW ARRIVALS use noindex,follow. Empty/unknown collections return
  404. Keep collection links as real anchors with optional JS enhancement.
- Refresh canonical, social metadata and JSON-LD on SPA navigation. Remove stale
  product metadata on the catalog and all JSON-LD on admin/cart views.
- `/ordering` is a factual, script-free ordering/delivery reference linked from
  storefront footers. FAQ claims must match visible content, without inventing
  policies. FAQ schema is NOT a promise of Google FAQ rich results.
- IndexNow runs on Tencent only through `luxe-indexnow.timer`. Its public proof
  key and submission ledger live outside Git in `/var/lib/luxe-search`.
  `/indexnow-key.txt` exposes only the public verification key. Submissions
  contain only changed/deleted public sitemap URLs, never orders/customer data.
  Do not enable the timer on Alibaba. HTTP 200/202 means accepted, not indexed.
- The canonical public origin is `https://bebeauty.top`.
- Every published product has a stable, crawlable
  `/product/<percent-encoded-product-id>` URL. Keep product IDs stable.
- `/sitemap.xml` is generated from published, non-archived SQLite rows and must
  contain the home page plus every public product.
- `/robots.txt` must reference the canonical sitemap and disallow `/api/`.
- `/llms.txt` provides concise, factual catalog and ordering context for
  generative search systems. Keep it aligned with the visible Q/A and actual
  business process.
- Product pages must retain server-rendered title, description, canonical,
  Open Graph tags, Product schema, Breadcrumb schema, FAQ schema, semantic H1,
  image alt text, and related product links.
- Product cards use real anchor URLs even though JavaScript enhances navigation.
- API responses retain `X-Robots-Tag: noindex, nofollow`.
- Never add fake reviews, ratings, inventory claims, authenticity claims,
  delivery guarantees, company addresses, or certifications to structured
  data. GEO content must remain specific, consistent, and verifiable.
- Archived or unpublished products must return `404` from their product URL and
  must not appear in the sitemap.

## 10. Safe Change Workflow

1. Read this guide and inspect `git status` before editing.
2. Work only on source/configuration files needed for the change.
3. Run syntax checks and focused tests locally.
4. Verify no secrets or production data are staged.
5. Commit and push code/documentation to GitHub.
6. Back up Tencent production before a risky schema or data change.
7. Deploy code to Tencent without replacing its database, uploads, environment
   file, or virtual environment.
8. Restart `luxe-catalog`, test Nginx, then verify storefront, admin login,
   product API, image loading, and order Excel.
9. Trigger or wait for Tencent-to-Alibaba synchronization.
10. Verify Alibaba database integrity, counts, images, service status, and a
    sample public request.

Manual replication and timer commands:

```text
sudo systemctl start luxe-replication.service
sudo systemctl status luxe-replication.service
sudo systemctl enable --now luxe-replication.timer
```

Never use `rsync --delete` against a computed or unverified path. Verify both
absolute source and destination paths first. Code sync may delete obsolete code
only inside `/opt/luxe-catalog`; data sync may delete obsolete uploaded images
only inside `/var/lib/luxe-catalog/uploads`.

## 11. Required Verification

For each release, check at minimum:

- Python syntax: `python -m py_compile server.py`
- SQLite: `PRAGMA integrity_check` returns `ok`
- Nginx: `sudo nginx -t`
- Services: `nginx`, `luxe-catalog`, `firewalld`, and `fail2ban` are active
- Public home and `/api/products` return HTTP `200`
- Backend port `4173` is not publicly reachable
- Admin login/session works
- Create/update/archive and multi-image upload/delete work independently
- Existing order Excel downloads successfully and every populated cell uses
  Arial; the workbook Normal style is Arial and `styles.xml` contains no theme
  font scheme
- `/robots.txt`, `/sitemap.xml`, `/llms.txt`, and a sample `/product/...` URL
  return HTTP `200`
- Sitemap URL count equals published product count + distinct nonempty brands
  and categories (excluding the filter sentinel `All`) + home + ordering page
- `python scripts/test_seo.py` passes. Check server-rendered HTML without JS,
  single-collection canonicals, unknown product 404s and SPA metadata changes.
- Product HTML contains canonical, Product JSON-LD and semantic product content
- Tencent and Alibaba product/order counts match after replication

## 12. Backup And Recovery

- Tencent creates a complete daily backup and retains the newest three.
- Backups include application source, uploads, a consistent SQLite snapshot,
  environment/service configuration, Nginx configuration, TLS certificate and
  private key, Fail2ban jail configuration, and replication units.
- Alibaba is a warm standby, not a substitute for versioned backups.
- Before restoring, validate the archive and database integrity. Stop the app,
  restore atomically, fix ownership to `luxe:luxe`, start the service, and run
  the verification checklist.
- In a disaster, explicitly promote Alibaba before accepting admin writes.
  Disable the normal Tencent-to-Alibaba timer while Alibaba is promoted.
